        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>1 whole chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder</li>
            <li>5 cups vegetable oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk together buttermilk, mustard, salt, pepper, and cayenne in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour buttermilk marinade into a resealable plastic bag.</li>
            <li>Add chicken pieces, coat with marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag.</li>
            <li>Marinate in the refrigerator for 2 to 8 hours.</li>
            <li>Combine flour, baking powder, garlic powder, and onion powder in another resealable plastic bag; shake to mix thoroughly.</li>
            <li>Working with one piece at a time, transfer marinated chicken to the dry ingredient bag, seal the bag, and shake well to coat.</li>
            <li>After all chicken pieces are coated, repeat the process by dipping them in buttermilk marinade and shaking in the dry coating again.</li>
            <li>Then heat oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Place chicken on the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry chicken in batches in hot oil, turning chicken occasionally, until golden brown and juices run clear.</li>
            <li>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the meat should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Done and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
